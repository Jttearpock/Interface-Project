# Interface-Project
C# Part 2 Class Assignment: Game 2 - Interface Partner Project

The Interface project was a small partner project that combined the previous Sudoku and Mancala projects into one single program. We were also tasked with creating a interface that did more than simply launch the games. In this case my partner and I added statistics data about games played.

### What I did
For the Interface project I specifically did everything related to statistics for Mancala. Most of which can be found under the SaveResults() method in the MainWindow.xaml.cs file for Mancala. In the MainWindow.xaml.cs file for Interface, I also wrote the LoadData() method for the Mancala data as well as the ResetMancala_Click() event method. The Sudoku side of the statistics was done by my partner and together we wrote the rest of the Interface code.
